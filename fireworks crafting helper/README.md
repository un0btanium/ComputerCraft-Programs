# Fireworks Crafting Helper

Hello everyone,

fireworks are really nice to look at, i have to say, but the crafting recipes are annoying and it takes time to get into every single detail and ingredient. So i invented the Fireworks Crafting Helper


## Features:

- just needs a crafty turtle
- create firework stars and put these together to rockets
- can handle all 20,846,397,359,932,200 unique rocket combinations
- turtle presents all colors, fadecolors, shapes, effects and flight height.
- turtle descripes which item is needed and where you can get it from
- can craft up to 64 items at a time
- keypresses only (W A S D C R and Q)
- throws an error if using a computer or not a crafty turtle
- can handle normal and advanced turtles (color support)


## How to use:

Download the program via pastebin by tipping in the following code into your crafty turtle:
<code>pastebin get 8a5B4SU4 startup</code>
And start the program:
<code>startup</code>

Select menus and interacti with the program with your keyboard keys.

## Main Menu:
Select if you want to create a firework star or a rocket with allready created firework stars. From here you can exit the program as well.

### Create a firework star:
Select the color as well as the optional things like fade out color, shape and effect. An overview let you check everything before crafting your firework star. Then it shows you one by one which item you have to put into the turtle's current selected inventory slot to craft your firework star. Be aware that you can create up to 64 at once, so count your items before and put them directly into the slot.
Take your firework star out, create it again or go back to the main menu.

### Create a rocket:
This requires allready created firework stars (at least one). Insert some paper and, depending on your selected flight height, gunpowder. At least all you firework stars (up to seven). Hit a button and it crafts you one or more rockets.
Keep in mind that the turtle is using the standard 3x3 crafting patter, which allows just 9 items to be crafted together. If every slot is full it automatically crafts you the rocket!


## Updates:

### BETA 0.2.0
- added color support
- improved positioning of text

### FINAL VERSION 1.0.0
- added possibility to select up to 8 colors at once for one star (depends which shape and effect you select)
- improved color looks in places
- fixed help information for ink sac

This is the final version 1.0.0! Hopefully nothing has to be changed anymore!
That's it! I created this little program for being added as tresure disk in the new computercraft version.

I hope you enjoy! :D
