# Planetz Under Gravity [Game][0.3.0][Advanced Computer Version Available]

Hello everybody,

a lot of members here are releasing their own game or a remake of an old game in the past.
This game is based on a game, which i made in the past, but never finished. (It may remind you of Sokoban)
Nevertheless, i am going to reprogram this game here in lua for ComputerCraft and Minecraft, because i had a lot of fun with it. So here we go! I am presenting you

## Planetz Under Gravity


### What is Planetz Under Gravity?
Planetz Under Gravity is a remake of Curling Planetz, a puzzle game created in the year 2010 by myself.
You are in space between black holes and dangerous suns, trying to save all your home planets. How?
Well, that sounds crazy now, but you have to change the gravity for the planets to navigate them to the next wormhole/gate/whatever
The problem is, that your planets have a lot of mass on them. Once they move into a direction, they have to be stopped by an asteroid pile.

### History!
I made this game with a program called Gamemaker8 back in 2010, but never finished it how i wanted to.
It had another name ("Curling Planetz") but right now it sounds really lame for me. I am still not very happy with the name, but i will see what i am comming up with. Wanted to gave it a theme so and the space is allways a nice place to play with ;p
I wanted to add a link here to the Curling Planetz, but it seems that i cant find it in the World Wide Web anymore :'(

## How to install?

### Advanced Computer Version:

pastebin get gGg6gTF0 PUG

or

pastebin get gGg6gTF0 startup


### Advanced Monitor Version (still run it on an advanced computer):
pastebin get YeigVfWy PUG

or

pastebin get YeigVfWy startup


## What do I need to play this game?
You just need an advanced computer. You have to download the Advanced Computer Version above and run it with the name you gave it.
Keep in mind: Levels for advanced computers are not available for the advanced monitor version!


## What do I need to play this game on advanced monitors?
Right now, you need advanced monitors in a four by four pattern (16 monitors, 32 gold ingots).
An advanced computer at the left side of it (if you are standing in front of it).
Download the game and various level from pastebin and start the program.
Because this version uses a slightly higher "resolution" you can make bigger levels:
Computer: 51*19=969
4x4 Monitor: 29*39=1131 16.7% more
Keep in mind: Levels for advanced monitors are not available for the just advanced computer version!

## How to play?
Rightclick on play and choose a level.
Right click with your mouse on the following monitors to change gravity:


Blue --- Planet

Gray --- Asteroid

Light Gray --- Incomming Asteroid

Orange --- Goal/Wormhole/Gate

Red --- Sun/Death

Yellow --- Gates let asteroids appear and disappear

Brown --- Moon; they are effected by gravity as well, but are not important to complete the level like the planets are

## How to create an own level?
Rightclick on editor, choose an existing level or create a new one.
Click on GUI to open up the selector panel. Select from the game blocks and place it on the playfield.
Close the GUI to place blocks in the top left and top right corner.
Save and name your level with a rightclick on SAVE.

## Send me your own level!
If you send me your own level i will add it to the list of costum levels.
You find your level in your <minecraftFolder>/saves/<worldName>/computer/<computerNumber>/PUG_<idividualLevelNumber>
Open the file with the wordpad/editor, hit Ctrg+A (select everything) and Ctrg+C (copy).
Open pastebin and Ctrg+V (paste) it. Finish it and send me the link per personal message.

## How to download a level?
I created some quick test level here. Select Add in the main menu and paste in the whole link from pastebin or just the 8 code characters and hit Enter.

## Why is this still early beta?
Well, i need help! There exist some bugs and i have to shorten code a bit.
I also want to add levelpacks instead of single levels by their own and make a original levelpack build-in.
More blocks might be added in the future as well to keep it even more interesting. Have a lot in mind ;D

Unfortunatly, i need help! If someone want to check some code out and maybe find a possible solution for this:
If a planet runs out of the screen on the top or bottom it gets destroyed perfectly.
If the planet runs out on the left or right the program crashes. I was trying to fix it before posting it, but after a whole hour with no progress i gave up for the moment and posted it. Maybe someone can find it, however i know that it is a messy code and takes a lot of time to get into. :s
