Hello everyone,

since Generikb is making an huge alveary modell on the mindcrack feed the beast server and someone mentioned adding a huge pipe system as well, i tought about moving items in these pipes.
I did some math about the size of these pipes in the skale of 9:16 generikb is using and came up with

# MegaPipe

## How to set up

For every screen you need one advanced computer and a modem.
Place the computer with the back to the screen, the modem on top and paste in the correct code down below.
Then start the program with
<code>startup</code>

#### Wooden pipe:
3x3 screen
<code>pastebin get ptujxT9T startup</code>


#### Wooden pipe segment:
2x3 screen
<code>pastebin get sxeL3Bdi startup</code>


#### Alveary pipe:
3x3 screen
<code>pastebin get ZpANUDw6 startup</code>



These following screens are optional:

#### Stone pipe segment:
2x3 screen
<code>pastebin get 1g2KWr2J startup</code>

#### Stone pipe:
3x3 screen
<code>pastebin get CbcJkU45 startup</code>




### Customization

After you downloaded the programs you can open them up with

<code>edit startup</code>

At the third line you fine a variable called "speed" with a number behind the equals sign.
You can set it to:

0.1 --- Very fast

0.25 --- Fast

0.5 --- Standard

1 --- Slow

2 --- Very Slow

Hit Ctrg, hit Enter, hit Ctrg again and your right arrowkey and hit Enter again.
Now start the program up.



That's it! Right now there is just this constellation available, but if you want to have other directions or features, let me know about it.

Hope you enjoy :P
